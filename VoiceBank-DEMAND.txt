VoiceBank-DEMAND Dataset
------------------------

The VoiceBank-DEMAND dataset is a widely used benchmark for speech enhancement and denoising tasks. It is designed to evaluate the performance of algorithms that aim to remove noise from speech signals.

**Key Features:**
- Contains clean and noisy speech pairs.
- Clean speech is sourced from the Voice Bank corpus, spoken by multiple speakers (28 for training, 2 for testing).
- Noisy speech is generated by mixing clean speech with various real-world noise recordings from the DEMAND database.
- Noises include domestic, nature, office, public, street, and transportation environments.
- Noisy samples are created at different SNR (Signal-to-Noise Ratio) levels: 15, 10, 5, and 0 dB.

**Structure:**
- `trainset_28spk_wav/`: Training set with 28 speakers.
- `testset_wav/`: Test set with 2 speakers.
- Each set contains paired `clean` and `noisy` audio files in `.wav` format.

**File-level Structure:**
Each audio file is a single-channel (mono) WAV file. When loaded (for example, using torchaudio or librosa), each file is represented as a 2D array or tensor with shape:

    [channels, samples]

For this dataset:
- `channels` = 1 (mono audio)
- `samples` = the number of audio samples in the file, which depends on the duration and sample rate (e.g., at 16,000 Hz, a 2-second file has 32,000 samples).

So, for a typical file:
- Shape: [1, N], where N is the length in samples (varies per file, but all files in a pair have the same N).

Example:
- A 3-second file at 16 kHz: shape = [1, 48000]
- A 2-second file at 48 kHz: shape = [1, 96000]

Each file contains raw waveform data as floating-point values, with one value per sample.

**Typical Usage:**
- Used for training and evaluating deep learning models for speech denoising.
- Standard evaluation metrics include PESQ, STOI, and SDR.
